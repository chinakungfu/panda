						<p>If the item meets the characteristics described by seller and corresponds your request (color, size, configuration, etc.) and there are no defects, such item is not eligible for return and refund, It is only possible to return items which are significantly different from photographs and description provided by the seller. Warning: some taobao sellers don’t accept return/exchange if they have shipped the correct item. In this case, we cannot do it either.</p><br>
						<p>In case of return/exchange of item, it costs 35 yuan as additional service and any shipping fee that would involve is on your charge.</p><br>
						<p>Request to return/exchange items should be done from your order page using the corresponding option next to the items. If the seller agrees to refund, we will send the goods back – your order will be updated only after the seller refunds us, then we will recalculate your order.</p><br>
